The e-rickshaw booking web app is a user-friendly platform designed to facilitate the booking of e-rickshaws online. It offers a seamless experience for users to easily book e-rickshaws for their transportation needs. The web app is built using React, a popular JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.

The app provides different interfaces for three main user roles: students, drivers, and administrators.

For students, the web app offers a simple and intuitive interface to book e-rickshaws. Students can enter their pickup location, destination, and desired date and time for the ride. The app validates the input and ensures that the selected date and time are in the future. Upon successful booking, the details are stored in a Firebase Firestore database.

Drivers have their own interface where they can view and accept pending bookings. The driver interface shows a list of available bookings, including the pickup location, destination, and date/time. Drivers can choose to accept a booking, which updates the booking status in the database.

Administrators have access to an admin interface that allows them to manage the overall system. They can add new bookings manually, which are then made available for drivers to accept. The admin interface provides an overview of all bookings and allows administrators to monitor and manage the system's operations.

The web app leverages Firebase for its backend services, including Firebase Firestore for real-time data storage and retrieval. Authentication and user management are handled using Firebase's authentication service.

Overall, the e-rickshaw booking web app offers a convenient and efficient way for students to book e-rickshaws, drivers to accept bookings, and administrators to manage the system effectively. It simplifies the process of e-rickshaw booking and enhances the overall experience for all stakeholders involved.
